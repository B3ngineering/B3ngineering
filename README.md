# Hi, I'm Ben.

Software, robotics, and systems.

Vibe coding is obsolete.

## My Work

* Currently developing a [robotics middleware tool](https://github.com/B3ngineering/rust-middleware) inspired by ROS using Rust for speed and concurrency.

* Led the integration of Nightingale Security drones with ATAK for first responders and military using Python and MAVLink. Check out the middle of [this page](https://www.nightingalesecurity.com/military-defense/) for more.

* Made my own [maze-solving robot simulator](https://github.com/B3ngineering/Micromouse-V2) using C++, ROS, and Gazebo to explore pathfinding algorithm heursitics.

* Led the development of telescope alignment software used for Quantum Key Distribution testing, you can see the system in [this article](https://www.mechatronicscanada.ca/latest-articles/how-qeynet-is-enabling-quantum-communications-in-space-on-a-global-scale/) by Mechatronics Canada.
